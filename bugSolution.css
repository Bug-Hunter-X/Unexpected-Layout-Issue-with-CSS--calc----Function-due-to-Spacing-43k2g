The solution is to remove the extra space within the `calc()` function expression:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

By removing the space after the `-` operator, the correct calculation is performed, and the element's width will be 50% of its parent's width, minus 10px. This simple change ensures that the `calc()` function works as expected.
